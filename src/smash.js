/**
 * What happens when Rock runs into someone. There is no roll of the dice:
 * it is how fast he was going. `speed` is how fast the two were coming
 * together, in tiles a second — Rock's roll plus theirs, and a drop onto
 * them from above counts for something too.
 *
 *   crit    twice what it takes: flattened. Nothing back, double the hype.
 *   smash   fast enough: gone, with nothing back.
 *   bonk    over half what it takes: the two bounce apart, and it costs Rock
 *           some of the foe's `power` — less the closer he was to a smash.
 *   tap     barely a touch: it hurts, and doesn't move them.
 *
 * Whatever isn't a smash still wears them down: a foe has as much `hp` as it
 * has `toughness`, and a bonk takes off as much as the speed it came at. So
 * a bouncer who can't be hit hard enough can be hit twice. A boss has a
 * good deal more than that, and never goes down for nothing: a smash on
 * one still costs Rock a quarter of its power.
