 * part of the body is painted as), a face (`face`), their hair, whatever
 * extra they are wearing or carrying (`extras`, a function that adds shapes
 * to the sculpt, given the joints), and how they move (`style`, passed to
 * `moveHumanoid`, with an `after` hook for anything particular to them).
 *
 * `person({ ... })` gives a model definition, as every other creature is.
